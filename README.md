# Hangman

**Hangman** is a game for single player only. This is a straightforward game written in the Python Programming language. The Hangman chooses a word at random from a list of 20 words. A player is given some blank spots in which to guess a word. The number of turns is the same as the number of characters in the word. By guessing the proper word within the allotted turns, the player can win the game. If the player runs out of turns before guessing the word, player will lose the game. This program also keeps track of the games played and collects player information. This is a short project to improve programming skills and logic comprehension.
